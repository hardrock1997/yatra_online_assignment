## Features

- Responsive Design	Fully responsive layout adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop (single-row layout ‚â•1024px).
- City Input with Suggestions	Implements a city search input with real-time suggestions dropdown (autocomplete behavior).
- Date Picker	Dual date pickers for check-in and check-out with min-date set to the current day.
- Guest Selector	Custom input field for selecting number of guests, with icon and input validation.
- Search Button	Custom-styled button with embedded icon; triggers search and routes to result page on submit.
- Error Handling	Validates inputs and displays user-friendly messages if fields are incomplete or invalid.
- Navigation on Search	On valid input, navigates to the results page with query parameters (e.g., city, date, guests).
- Visual Enhancements	Integrated SVG icons for UI clarity (calendar, guests, search icon, back button).
- Component-Based Structure	Modular, reusable React components (e.g., HotelsSearcher, HotelCitiesSuggestions, Button).
- Styling with CSS Modules	Scoped and maintainable styling using CSS Modules for clean separation of concerns.

## Assumptions Made
- City suggestions are based on a predefined list or mocked data (not fetched from a live API).

- Only cities are searchable in the input field ‚Äî no hotel names, areas, or pin codes.

- Date logic assumes users must select both check-in and check-out dates.

- Guests field supports selection of a total number of guests only ‚Äî no categorization (e.g., adults vs. children).

- Navigation assumes the presence of a /hotels route that accepts query parameters:
?city=...&checkin=...&checkout=...&guests=...

- The form does not include price range, hotel filters, or room selection features.

- The design prioritizes desktop view with all inputs aligned in one row for screens ‚â•1024px.
